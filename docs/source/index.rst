C4Dynamics (read Tsipor (bird) Dynamics) is the open-source framework of algorithms development for objects in space and time.  
It is a Python library that provides entities for developing and analyzing algorithms of physical systems, that is, system with dynamics, with one or more of the internal systems and algorithms of C4dynamics:  
Sensors | 
Detectors | 
Filters | 
Math Operations |
Or with one of the 3rd party libraries integrated with C4dynamics:
OpenCV |
YOLO |
NumPy |
Matplotlib
