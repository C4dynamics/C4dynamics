Here's how you can add a use case to the [Programs section](https://c4dynamics.github.io/C4dynamics/programs/index.html) of the documentation: 
* Fork the repository (top-right corner of the [GitHub page](https://github.com/C4dynamics/C4dynamics))
* Pick a starting point: choose a classic simulation or an existing project as your base.
* Build with [state objects](https://c4dynamics.github.io/C4dynamics/api/States.html).
* Extend with modules from the scientific library (e.g. [sensors](https://c4dynamics.github.io/C4dynamics/api/Sensors.html), [filters](https://c4dynamics.github.io/C4dynamics/api/Filters.html), [detectors](https://c4dynamics.github.io/C4dynamics/api/Detectors.html)).  
* Write your program in a Jupyter notebook:
- Keep it simple yet functional.   
- Add comments and documentation to explain your approach.  
* Test thoroughly: make sure it runs without errors and produces meaningful results.  
* Visualize outputs: use c4dynamics plotting tools.  
* Submit a pull request with your notebook and a short description of what it demonstrates.
âœ¨ Thatâ€™s it! Your example will help other engineers learn and build faster.
