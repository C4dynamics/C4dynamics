`c4dynamics` is a framework for algorithms development.


**what are state objects?**
Navigation, Control, ... are all characetarized by a basic 
entity which is a state vector for math operations.. 

A state object represents a state vector and other attributes 
that form an entity of a physical (dynamic) system.    
  
Don't ever get messy with ton of objects and variables. 

With `c4dynamics` your object includes everything you need for your state:

\\ plane, resistor-capacitor, x signal, 
\\ x-y image pixels. 

.. code::
   
   >>> plane = c4d.state(z = 1000, gamma = 10)
   >>> print(plane)
   [z  Î³] 

.. code::

   >>> plane.X 
   [1000    10]

`c4dynamics` is the open-source framework of algorithms development 
for objects in space and time.  

It is a Python library that provides entities for developing and analyzing algorithms of physical systems, that is, system with dynamics, with one or more of the internal systems and algorithms of C4dynamics:  

- Sensors 
- Detectors 
- Filters 
- Math Operators 

Or with one of the 3rd party libraries integrated with C4dynamics:

- OpenCV
- YOLO
- Open3D
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
