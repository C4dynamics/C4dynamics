c4dynamics objects, modules and functions 

This reference manual details functions, modules, and objects
included in C4dynamics, describing what they are and what they do.


A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE NAME SPACE. e.g.: All functions and classes 
should be accessed from the pooch top-level namespace. Modules inside 
of the pooch package are meant mostly for internal organization. Please 
avoid importing directly from submodules since functions/classes may be moved around.
