# Quickstart for Contributors

* Press the 'Fork' button (upper right corner of the C4dynamics page)
* Clone C4dynamics to your local machine (GitHub Desktop is a nice tool to help you clone and push your changes back)
* Open a new python notebook (Jupyter) 
* Import C4dynamics to your notebook (see some examples in the repository 'examples')
* In the notebook, write some code you would like to do using the C4dynamics library
* Create and edit files in C4dynamics to support your code
* Make tests and document your changes
* Push the changes back to your GitHub
* Press the 'Pull Request' button. Submit a message with details about your changes.

* It's a good advise to start with the example dof6sim.ipynb and change the missile-target conditions to gain some experience with the framework. This example appears also down here in the README
