class seeker(c4d.rigidbody):
  '''
  Direction seeker.

  The :class:`seeker` class models sensors that 
  measure the direction to a target in terms of azimuth and elevation. 
  Such sensors typically use electro-optical or laser technologies, 
  though other technologies may also be used.  

  A `seeker` object can operate in an ideal mode, 
  providing precise direction measurements. 
  Alternatively, in a non-ideal mode, 
  the measurements may be affected by errors such as
  `scale factor`, `bias`, and `noise`,  
  as defined by the errors model. 
  A random variable generation mechanism allows 
  for Monte Carlo simulations.

  **Functionality**

  At each sample the seeker returns measures based on the true geometry 
  with the target.

  Let the relative coordinates in an arbitrary frame of reference: 

  .. math::

    dx = target.x - seeker.x

    dy = target.y - seeker.y

    dz = target.z - seeker.z
  

  The relative coordinates in the seeker body frame are given by: 

  .. math::

    x_b = [BR] \\cdot [dx, dy, dz]^T 

  where :math:`[BR]` is a 
  Body from Reference DCM (Direction Cosine Matrix)
  formed by the seeker three Euler angles. See the `rigidbody` section below. 

  The azimuth and elevation measures are then the spatial angles: 
  
  .. math:: 

    az = tan^{-1}{x_b[1] \\over x_b[0]}

    el = tan^{-1}{x_b[2] \\over \\sqrt{x_b[0]^2 + x_b[1]^2}}

  

  Where:

  - :math:`az` is the azimuth angle
  - :math:`el` is the elevation angle
  - :math:`x_b` is the target-radar position vector in radar body frame

  .. figure:: /_static/figures/seeker/definitions.svg
    
    Fig-1: Azimuth and elevation angles definition   


  
  **Errors Model**
  
  The azimuth and elevation angles are subject to errors: scale factor, bias, and noise.

  - ``Bias``: 
    represents a constant offset or deviation from the 
    true value in the seeker's measurements. 
    It is a systematic error that consistently affects the measured values. 
    The bias of a `seeker` instance is a normally distributed variable with `mean = 0` 
    and `std = bias_std`, where `bias_std` is a parameter with default value of `0.1°`.
  - ``Scale Factor``: 
    a multiplier applied to the true value of a measurement. 
    It represents a scaling error in the measurements made by the seeker. 
    The scale factor of a `seeker` instance is 
    a normally distributed variable 
    with `mean = 0` and `std = scale_factor_std`, 
    , where `scale_factor_std` is a parameter with default value of `0.05`. 
  - ``Noise``: 
    represents random variations or fluctuations in the measurements 
    that are not systematic. 
    The noise at each seeker sample (:meth:`measure`) 
    is a normally distributed variable 
    with `mean = 0` and `std = noise_std`, where `noise_std` 
    is a parameter with default value of `0.4°`.  

    
  The errors model generates random variables for each seeker instance, 
  allowing for the simulation of different scenarios or variations in the seeker behavior
  in a technique known as Monte Carlo. 
  Monte Carlo simulations leverage this randomness to statistically analyze 
  the impact of these biases and scale factors over a large number of iterations, 
  providing insights into potential outcomes and system reliability.






  The errors model can be disabled by applying `isideal = True` at the seeker construction stage. 

  The erros model operates as follows: the particular parameters 
  that form each error, for example the standard deviation of the bias error, 
  may be determined at the stage of creating the sensor object: 
  :code:`seeker = c4d.sensors.seeker(bias_std = 0.1 * c4d.d2r)`, 
  where `c4d.d2r` is a conversion from degrees to radians. 
  Then, the errors model generates a normal random variable 
  and establishes the seeker bias error.
  However, the user can override the generated bias by 
  using the :attr:`bias` property and determine the seeker bias error: 
  :code:`seeker.bias = 1 * c4d.d2r`, to have a 1° bias error.  
   
  
  

  **rigidbody**
  
  The seeker class is a subclass of :class:`rigidbody <c4dynamics.states.lib.rigidbody.rigidbody>`, i.e. 
  it suggests attributes of position and attitude and the manipulation of them.

  As a fundamental propety, the 
  rigidbody's state vector 
  :attr:`X <c4dynamics.states.state.state.X>` 
  sets the spatial coordinates of the seeker:

  .. math::

    X = [x, y, z, v_x, v_y, v_z, {\\varphi}, {\\theta}, {\\psi}, p, q, r]^T 

  The first six coordinates determine the translational position and velocity of the seeker 
  while the last six determine its angular attitude in terms of Euler angles and 
  the body rates. 

  Passing a rigidbody parameter as an `origin` sets 
  the initial conditions of the seeker. 

  
  
  **Construction**

  A seeker instance is created by making a direct call 
  to the seeker constructor: 

  .. code:: 

    skr = c4d.sensors.seeker()

  Initialization of the instance does not require any 
  mandatory arguments, but the seeker parameters can be 
  determined using the \\**kwargs argument as detailed above.




  Examples 
  ========


  **Target**
  

  For the examples below let's generate the trajectory of a target with constant velocity:   

  .. code::

    >>> tgt = c4d.datapoint(x = 1000, y = 0, vx = -80 * c4d.kmh2ms, vy = 10 * c4d.kmh2ms)
    >>> for t in np.arange(0, 60, 0.01):
    ...   tgt.inteqm(np.zeros(3), .01)
    ...   tgt.store(t)

  The method :meth:`inteqm <c4dynamics.states.lib.datapoint.datapoint.inteqm>` 
  of the 
  :class:`datapoint <c4dynamics.states.lib.datapoint.datapoint>` class 
  integrates the 3 degrees of freedom equations of motion with respect to 
  the input force vector (`np.zeros(3)` here). 
  
  .. figure:: /_static/figures/seeker/target.png

  Since the call to :meth:`measure` requires a target as a `datapoint` object 
  we utilize a custom `create` function that returns a new `datapoint` object for 
  a given `X` state vector in time. 

  - :code:`c4d.kmh2ms` converts kilometers per hour to meters per second.
  - :code:`c4d.r2d` converts radians to degrees.
  - :code:`c4d.d2r` converts degrees to radians.

  
  **Origin**
  
  Let's also introduce a pedestal as an origin for the seeker. 
  The pedestal is a `rigidbody` object with position and attitude: 

  .. code:: 

    >>> pedestal = c4d.rigidbody(z = 30, theta = -1 * c4d.d2r)

    

  **Ideal Seeker**
  
  Measure the target position with an ideal seeker:

  .. code::

    >>> skr_ideal = c4d.sensors.seeker(origin = pedestal, isideal = True)
    >>> for x in tgt.data():
    ...   skr_ideal.measure(c4d.create(x[1:]), t = x[0], store = True)
    
  Comparing the seeker measurements with the true target angles requires 
  converting the relative position to the seeker body frame: 

  .. code:: 

    >>> dx =  tgt.data('x')[1] - skr_ideal.x
    >>> dy =  tgt.data('y')[1] - skr_ideal.y
    >>> dz =  tgt.data('z')[1] - skr_ideal.z
    >>> Xb = np.array([skr_ideal.BR @ [X[1] - skr_ideal.x, X[2] - skr_ideal.y, X[3] - skr_ideal.z] for X in tgt.data()])

  where :attr:`skr_ideal.BR <c4dynamics.states.lib.rigidbody.rigidbody.BR>` is a 
  Body from Reference DCM (Direction Cosine Matrix)
  formed by the seeker three Euler angles

  Now `az_true` is the true target azimuth angle with respect to the seeker, and 
  `el_true` is the true elevation angle (`atan2d` is an aliasing of `numpy's arctan2` 
  with a modification returning the angles in degrees): 

  .. code:: 

    >>> az_true = c4d.atan2d(Xb[:, 1], Xb[:, 0])
    >>> el_true = c4d.atan2d(Xb[:, 2], c4d.sqrt(Xb[:, 0]**2 + Xb[:, 1]**2))
    >>> # plot results
    >>> fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1)
    >>> axs[0].plot(tgt.data('t'), az_true, label = 'target')
    >>> axs[0].plot(*skr_ideal.data('az', scale = c4d.r2d), label = 'seeker')
    >>> axs[1].plot(tgt.data('t'), el_true)
    >>> axs[1].plot(*skr_ideal.data('el', scale = c4d.r2d))

  .. figure:: /_static/figures/seeker/ideal.png


  **Non-ideal Seeker**
  

  Measure the target position with a *non-ideal* seeker. 
  The seeker's errors model introduces bias, scale factor, and 
  noise that corrupt the measurements: 

  .. code:: 

    >>> skr = c4d.sensors.seeker(origin = pedestal)
    >>> for x in tgt.data():
    ...   skr.measure(c4d.create(x[1:]), t = x[0], store = True)

  With respect to the ideal seeker: 

  .. code:: 

    >>> fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1)
    >>> axs[0].plot(*skr_ideal.data('az', scale = c4d.r2d), label = 'ideal')
    >>> axs[0].plot(*skr.data('az', scale = c4d.r2d), label = 'non-ideal')
    >>> axs[1].plot(*skr_ideal.data('el', scale = c4d.r2d))
    >>> axs[1].plot(*skr.data('el', scale = c4d.r2d))

  .. figure:: /_static/figures/seeker/nonideal.png


  The bias, scale factor, and noise that used to generate these measures 
  can be examined by: 

  .. code::

    >>> skr.bias * c4d.r2d
    0.2
    >>> skr.scale_factor
    1.05
    >>> skr.noise_std
    0.01

  Points to consider here: 

  - The scale factor error increases with the angle, such that for a :math:`5%` 
    scale factor, 
    the error of :math:`Azimuth = 100°` is :math:`5°`, whereas the error for 
    :math:`Elevation = -15°` is only :math:`-0.75°`.  
  - The standard deviation of the noise in the two channels is the same. 
    However, as the `Elevation` values are confined to a smaller range, the effect 
    appears more pronounced there.  

    
  **Rotating Seeker**
  

  Measure the target position with a rotating seeker. 
  The seeker origin is yawing (performed by the increment of :math:`\\psi`) in the direction of the target motion: 


  .. code::
    
    >>> skr = c4d.sensors.seeker(origin = pedestal)
    >>> for x in tgt.data():
    ...   skr.psi += .02 * c4d.d2r 
    ...   skr.measure(c4d.create(x[1:]), t = x[0], store = True)
    ...   skr.store(x[0])

  The seeker yaw angle: 

  .. figure:: /_static/figures/seeker/psi.png

  And the target angles with respect to the yawing seeker are: 

  .. code:: 

    >>> fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1)
    >>> axs[0].plot(*skr_ideal.data('az', c4d.r2d), label = 'ideal static seeker')
    >>> axs[0].plot(*skr.data('az', c4d.r2d), label = 'non-ideal yawing seeker')
    >>> axs[1].plot(*skr_ideal.data('el', scale = c4d.r2d))
    >>> axs[1].plot(*skr.data('el', scale = c4d.r2d))

  .. figure:: /_static/figures/seeker/yawing.png

  
  - The rotation of the seeker with the target direction 
    keeps the azimuth angle limited, such that non-rotating seekers with limited FOV (field of view) 
    would have lost the target. 
  


  **Operation Time**
  
  By default, the seeker returns measurments for each 
  call to :meth:`measure`. However, setting the parameter `dt` 
  to a positive number makes `measure` return `None` 
  for any `t < last_t + dt`, where `t` is the current measure time, 
  `last_t` is the last measurement time, and `dt` is the seeker time-constant: 

  .. code:: 
  
    >>> tgt = c4d.datapoint(x = 100, y = 100)
    >>> skr = c4d.sensors.seeker(dt = 0.01)
    >>> for t in np.arange(0, .025, .005):
    ...   print(f'{t}: {skr.measure(tgt, t = t)}')
    0.0:   (0.78648039 0.00732226)
    0.005: (None, None)
    0.01:  [0.78032395 0.00116011)
    0.015: (None, None)
    0.02:  (0.77982265 -0.00503559)


  **Random Distribution** 

  The distribution of normally generated random variables across mutliple seeker instances  
  is shown for biases of two groups of seekers: 

  - One group generated with a default `bias_std` of `0.1°`.
  - The second group with `bias_std` of 0.5°. 
  
  .. code:: 

    >>> from c4dynamics.sensors import seeker
    >>> seekers_type_A = []
    >>> seekers_type_B = []
    >>> B_std = 0.5 * c4d.d2r
    >>> for i in range(1000):
    ...   seekers_type_A.append(seeker().bias * c4d.r2d)
    ...   seekers_type_B.append(seeker(bias_std = B_std).bias * c4d.r2d)
  
  The histogram highlights the broadening of the distribution 
  as the standard deviation increases:

  .. code:: 

    >>> ax = plt.subplot()
    >>> ax.hist(seekers_type_A, 30, label = 'Type A')
    >>> ax.hist(seekers_type_B, 30, label = 'Type B')

    bias : float 
        Required bias, [radians]. 

    Returns

    bias : float 
        Current bias, [radians]. 

        
    Example
    -------

    The following example for a `seeker` object is directly applicable 
    to a `radar` object too.
    Simply replace :code:`c4d.sensors.seeker(origin = pedestal,...)` 
    with :code:`c4d.sensors.radar(origin = pedestal,...)`.


    **Auxiliary objects** 
    
    (see :class:`seeker` examples for more details): 

    
    Target: 

    .. code::

      >>> tgt = c4d.datapoint(x = 1000, y = 0, vx = -80 * c4d.kmh2ms, vy = 10 * c4d.kmh2ms)

    **Tracking with bias** 

    Define a seeker with a bias error only (mute the scale factor and the noise)

      ...   skr.measure(c4d.create(x[1:]), t = x[0], store = True)


    Compare the biased seeker with the true target angles (ideal seeker):

      >>> ax.plot(*skr_ideal.data('el', scale = c4d.r2d), label = 'target')
      >>> ax.plot(*skr.data('el', scale = c4d.r2d), label = 'seeker')

    Example
    -------

  
    The distribution of normally generated random variables 
    is characterized by its bell-shaped curve, which is symmetric about the mean.
    The area under the curve represents probability, with about `68%` of the data 
    falling within one standard deviation (1σ) of the mean, `95%` within two, 
    and `99.7%` within three,   
    making it a useful tool for understanding and predicting data behavior.


    In `radar` objects, and `seeker` objects in general, 
    the `bias` and `scale factor` vary 
    among different instances to allow a realistic simulation 
    of performance behavior in a technique known as Monte Carlo.
    
    Let's examine the `bias` distribution across   
    
    mutliple `radar` instances with a default `bias_std = 0.3°`
    in comparison to `seeker` instances with a default `bias_std = 0.1°`:
        

    





    .. code::

      >>> radars.append(radar().bias * c4d.r2d)

  
    The histogram highlights the broadening of the distribution 
    as the standard deviation increases:

    **Tracking with scale factor** 

    Define a seeker with a scale factor error only (mute the bias and the noise) 
    and set it to `1.2 (= 20%)` to track a constant velocity target: 
    
    
    .. code:: 

      >>> skr = c4d.sensors.seeker(origin = pedestal, bias_std = 0, noise_std = 0)
      >>> skr.scale_factor = 1.2
      >>> for x in tgt.data():
      ...   skr.measure(c4d.create(x[1:]), t = x[0], store = True)  
  

    Compare with the true target angles (ideal seeker):

    .. code::

      >>> ax = plt.subplot()
      >>> ax.plot(*skr_ideal.data('az', scale = c4d.r2d), label = 'target')
      >>> ax.plot(*skr.data('az', scale = c4d.r2d), label = 'seeker')

  def measure(self, target, t = -1, store = False):
    '''
    Measures azimuth and elevation between the seeker and a `target`. 


    If the seeker time-constant `dt` was provided when the `seeker` was created, 
    then `measure` returns `None` for any `t < last_t + dt`, 
    where `t` is the time input, `last_t` is the last measurement time, 
    and `dt` is the seeker time-constant. 
    Default behavior, returns measurements for each call.  
    
    If `store = True`, the method stores the measured 
    azimuth and elevation along with a timestamp 
    (`t = -1` by default, if not provided otherwise). 


    Parameters
    ----------
    target : `cartesian_state`
        A state object to measure by the seeker, including at least one position coordinate (x, y, z).  
    store : bool, optional
        A flag indicating whether to store the measured values. Defaults `False`.
    t : float, optional
        Timestamp [seconds]. Defaults -1.

    Returns
    -------
    out : tuple
        azimuth and elevation, [radians]. 
    

    Raises 
    ------
    ValueError
        If `target` doesn't include any position coordinate (x, y, z).  

                
    Example
    -------

    `measure` in a program simulating 
    real-time tracking of a constant velcoity target.

    
    The target is represented by a :class:`datapoint <c4dynamics.states.lib.datapoint.datapoint>` 
    and is simulated using the :mod:`eqm <c4dynamics.eqm>` module, 
    which integrating the point-mass equations of motion. 

    An ideal seeker uses as reference to the true position of the target. 

    At each cycle, the the seekers take measurements and store the samples for 
    later use in plotting the results.  

    
    .. code:: 

      >>> dt = 0.01
      >>> tgt = c4d.datapoint(x = 1000, vx = -80 * c4d.kmh2ms, vy = 10 * c4d.kmh2ms)
      >>> pedestal = c4d.rigidbody(z = 30, theta = -1 * c4d.d2r)
      >>> skr = c4d.sensors.seeker(origin = pedestal, dt = 0.05)
      >>> skr_ideal = c4d.sensors.seeker(origin = pedestal, isideal = True)
      >>> for t in np.arange(0, 60, dt):
      ...   tgt.inteqm(np.zeros(3), dt)
      ...   skr_ideal.measure(tgt, t = t, store = True)  
      ...   skr.measure(tgt, t = t, store = True)  
      ...   tgt.store(t)

    Before viewing the results, let's examine the error parameters generated by 
    the errors model (`c4d.r2d` converts radians to degrees): 

    .. code::

      >>> skr.bias * c4d.r2d
      -0.02
      >>> skr.scale_factor
      0.95 
      >>> skr.noise_std
      TODO 

    Then we excpect a constant bias of -0.02° and a 'compression' or 'squeeze' of `5%` with 
    respect to the target (as represented by the ideal seeker):  
    
    .. code::

      >>> ax = plt.subplot()
      >>> ax.plot(*skr_ideal.data('az', scale = c4d.r2d), '.m', markersize = 1, label = 'target')
      >>> ax.plot(*skr.data('az', scale = c4d.r2d), '.c', markersize = 1, label = 'seeker')

    .. figure:: /_static/figures/seeker/measure.png

    The sample rate of the seeker was set by the parameter `dt = 0.05`. 
    In cycles that don't satisfy `t < last_t + dt`, `measure` returns None, 
    as shown in a close-up view:
