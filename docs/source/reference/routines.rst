In this chapter routine docstrings are presented, grouped by functionality.
Many docstrings contain example code, which demonstrates basic usage
of the routine. The examples assume that C4dynamics is imported with::

  >>> import c4dynamics as c4d 

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   routines.eqm
   routines.rotmat
