API Reference
=============

This API documentation is a comprehensive guide 
to the various modules, classes, and functions 
available in `c4dynamics`. 
It covers everything from core components like **state 
objects**, which encapsulate system states, 
to modules like **sensors**, **detectors**, and **filters**.

The API reference serves as both a learning tool for 
newcomers and a quick lookup for experienced users.

For a quick overview of how to get started, 
see the **Getting Started** section, and for 
detailed use cases, refer to the **Programs** section.


Namespaces 
----------

State objects and utilities should be accessed 
from c4dynamics top-level namespace:

.. code::

  >>> import c4dynamics as c4d 
  >>> s = c4d.state(...)        # Access state objects directly from the top-level namespace
  >>> c4d.d2r                   # Access constants like degrees-to-radians conversion


Other modules and classes are available by preceding the module name:

.. code::

  >>> import c4dynamics as c4d 
  >>> rdr = c4d.sensors.radar(...)            
  >>> kf = c4d.filters.kalman(...)           


Datasets  
--------

Some examples in the following API reference use datasets 
to demonstrate c4dynamics functionality. 
c4dynamics uses `Pooch` to simplify fetching data files. 
By calling: 
:code:`c4dynamics.datasets.module(file)`, 
where ``module`` and ``file`` define the dataset, 
the dataset is downloaded over the network once 
and saved to the cache for later usa.

For more details, see the :mod:`datasets <c4dynamics.datasets>` module.
