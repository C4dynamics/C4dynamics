C4Dynamics (read Tsipor (bird) Dynamics) is the open-source framework of algorithms development for objects in space and time.  
It is a Python library that provides entities for developing and analyzing algorithms of physical systems, that is, system with dynamics, with one or more of the internal systems and algorithms of C4dynamics:  
ODE Solver (4th order Runge-Kutta)  
Kalman Filters  
Asymptotic Observer  
Radar Model  
IMU Model  
GPS Model  
Line Of Sight Seeker  
Or with one of the 3rd party libraries integrated with C4dynamics:  
OpenCV
YOLO
