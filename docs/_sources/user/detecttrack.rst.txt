******************************
Objects Detection and Tracking 
******************************


Detecting objects using the YOLOv3 model, updating and predicting their trajectories with the Kalman filter employing linear dynamics. Association between tracks is performed using scikit-learn's k-neighbors.
Each track is represented as a C4dynamics-datapoint, and the update and prediction are executed with the internal C4dynamics-Kalman-filter.

   **Figure**
   Conceptual diagram showing the relationship between the three
   fundamental objects used to describe the data in an array: 1) the
   ndarray itself, 2) the data-type object that describes the layout
   of a single fixed-size element of the array, 3) the array-scalar
   Python object that is returned when a single element of the array
   is accessed.
