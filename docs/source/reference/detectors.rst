..    Conceptual diagram showing the relationship between the three
..    fundamental objects used to describe the data in an array: 1) the
..    ndarray itself, 2) the data-type object that describes the layout
..    of a single fixed-size element of the array, 3) the array-scalar
..    Python object that is returned when a single element of the array
..    is accessed.
