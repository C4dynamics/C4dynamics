.. currentmodule:: c4dynamics 


The rigidbody is a class defining a rigid body in space, i.e. an object with length and angular position.
The rigidbody class extends the functionality of the datapoint class. 
It introduces additional attributes related to rotational dynamics, such as angular position, angular velocity, and moment of inertia. 
The class leverages the capabilities of the datapoint class for handling translational dynamics and extends it to include rotational aspects.

..    of a single fixed-size element of the array, 3) the array-scalar
..    Python object that is returned when a single element of the array
..    is accessed.
