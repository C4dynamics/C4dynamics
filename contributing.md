# Quickstart for Contributors ðŸš€

* Add a use case to the [Programs section](https://c4dynamics.github.io/C4dynamics/programs/index.html) of the documentation: 
* Press the 'Fork' button (top-right corner of the c4dynamics page)
* Choose a classic simulation or an existing project as your base.
* Employ state objects from c4dynamics.
* Incorporate modules from the scientific library (e.g. sensors, filters, detectors).  
* Create a Jupyter notebook and write your program.  
* Keep it simple yet functional.   
* Add comments and documentation to explain your approach.  
* Ensure it runs without errors and produces meaningful results.  
* Use c4dynamics tools (e.g., plotting functions) to visualize outputs.  
* Submit your example as a pull request.
