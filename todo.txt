3d visualization support for the 6dof history of the body.
mounting a camera on the side of the object and pridicting the image that the camera would film in any moment of the simulation. 
but what about integration for non-6dof systems? 

the datapoint and rigidbody objects should not have only functions to update their state from the physical equations of motions but also from methods that are based on visual techniques such as slam.
also update from gps wasn't implemented yet. 

options to stop of the run() function. the run functions simulate the eqm then when sth hits the ground may be am option to stop. 

when init dp or rb with non existing attribute there is no warning \ error throwing 

add option for title and labels in obj.draw()

change the inertial frame in z to pos upward - probably it's just the dof6 example
