The Rigid-Body (:class:`rigidbody`)
***********************************

The rigidbody is a class defining a rigid body in space, i.e. an object with length and angular position.
The rigidbody class extends the functionality of the datapoint class. 
It introduces additional attributes related to rotational dynamics, such as angular position, angular velocity, and moment of inertia. 
The class leverages the capabilities of the datapoint class for handling translational dynamics and extends it to include rotational aspects.
