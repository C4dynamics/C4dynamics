# NOTE 
# the line: 
# "Note that the divider of R is :math:`dt_{measure}` rather than simply :math:`dt` 
#   because often times the sampling-time of the measures is different than 
#   the sampling-time that uses to integrate the dynamics. 
#   However, when the measure times and the integration times are equal,
#   then :math:`dt_{measure} = dt`." 
# required clarification. i think i took it from simon. not sure. 
# anyway it's weird. as for a continuous system with Q = R 
# it's gone have balanced weights. 
# however the translation of it to discrete matrices with Q = Q*dt, R = R/dt 
# violates the balance.  
# I think it's realy wrong. in pg 232 (247) he says explicitly: 
# now let us think about measurement noise. suppose we have a discrete-time 
# measurement of a constant x every T seconds. The measurement times are tk = k*T (k=1,2,..).
# .. 
# the error covariance at time tk is independent of the sample time T if: R = Rc/T. 
# where Rc is some constant. 
# this implis that 
#     lim(R, T->0) = Rc * delta(t)
# where delta(t) is the constinuous time impulse function.
# this estabilshes the equivalence between white meausrement noise 
# in discrete time and continuous time. the effects of white measuremnt noise in discrete time
# and continuous time are the same if:
# vk ~ (0, R)
# v(t) ~ (0, Rc)
# i  think i should simply say that c4d kamlans are discrete kalmans.
# only that the user can provdie also cont. matrices. 
# and now that i think about that its become more clear to me 
# that what i should do is only suggest discrete filter and also 
# provide util for covnerting cont to discr system and then the user 
# provides the disc systems.  
# i rather think that best thing is to separate the covariance matrices from 
# discretization and just present it as given for the final system.
# or to add a remark and say that if also the covarinace matrices are given for 
# cont system then this the way to discretize it. 
# or add a note that in practice the noise of the discrete system should be know ampricialy or by data sheet. 
# or to add that in practice the sensors are taking measurements in discrete times. 
# 
# another problem arises: 
# the kalman is implemented as discrete-time system. 
# if the user provides system matrices A,B,C in the continuous-time domain, 
# then i ask also the time-step parameter and convert them to the discrete-time 
# form and then calculate the filter equations. 
# the problem that if the user provide continuous-time matrices, 
# probably he also provide his noise covariances Q and R in the continuous time domain, 
# which means that the noise descriptions do not match the discrete form of my filter. 
# what do u suggest to do?
# gpt: 
# convert q by yourself according to:  
#     Qd = A^-1 * (e^AT - I) * Qc
# R is in anyway sampled in disc times.
# alternatively change the model to discrete inputs only.   
# 
#
# FIXME 
# the example of the kalman filter must be fixed as there's no reason to 
# divide R here by dt becuase it's the vairance of the radar in the given time step!! 
# see figures in w.doc.

9.4.2 the discrete kf:
w(t) and v(t) have no time correlation.
E(w*w^T)=Rw=Q
E(v*v^T)=Rv=R

9.4.4. noise matrices and discerete equivalents.
the process uncertainty acts on the continuous portion of the system.  




i have a cont system sampled with a 
discrete samples camera. let's say the sensor errors with its algo are 
sig_camera in both position and bounding box. 
i want to show an example where i give the camera and the process the 
same weight and i run them in a steady state mode.
the model in const velocity model.  
then i say i want to overcome an error in the linearity and extend the 
uncertainty of the process with still continuous modeling of the process. 
** remark: how at all can kalman designers 
introduce the uncertainty in the noise? after all kalman 
restrains that factor to be a white noise with mean 0 and
im not sure the model uncertainty behaves in that way.
** any way in the next example i want to show 
that same results could be achieved by using discrete matrices.
