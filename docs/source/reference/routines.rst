In this chapter routine docstrings are presented, grouped by functionality.
Many docstrings contain example code, which demonstrates basic usage
of the routine. The examples assume that C4dynamics is imported with::

  >>> import c4dynamics as c4d 

A convenient way to execute examples is the ``%doctest_mode`` mode of
IPython, which allows for pasting of multi-line examples and preserves
indentation.
